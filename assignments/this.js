 * 1. In the global scope this will point to the window object
 * 2. Implicit binding means that this points to the object left of the dot
 * 3. New binding, this would refer to the new instance of the object that we are creating
 * 4. Explicit binding, is when we use call() or apply() to explicitly linking to a new context.
